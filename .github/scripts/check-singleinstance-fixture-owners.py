"""Fail the build when one SingleInstance codeunit is instantiated from more than
one TEST codeunit.

Why this exists
---------------
A `SingleInstance = true` codeunit gets exactly one instance per session, and that
instance is registered on the session's company -- `NCLMetaCodeunit.InternalCreateInstance`
adds it to `NavCompany.SingleInstanceCodeunits`, and only `NavCompany.Dispose` ever
clears that dictionary. Nothing in the test-execution path touches it:
`NavTestExecution.LeaveTestCodeunit` clears `executingTestCodeUnit` and nothing else.
(Verified identical on BC 27.5 and 28.4.)

So a SingleInstance fixture shared by two test codeunits is shared state with no
reset between them, and whichever test codeunit runs FIRST decides what the others
observe. That is BC behaving exactly as documented; the bug is the shared fixture.

This is not hypothetical. Issue #261: three test codeunits (60613/60614/60615) all
used `SIS Cache` (60608), each seeding a different currency into the one cached
record. The three BC 27.x legs ran 60615 first and the other two read its `CHF`;
the eight 28.x legs ran 60615 LAST and passed -- not by clearing anything, but by
ordering luck. Eight green legs measured nothing, which is the reason this check
looks at structure rather than at a run's outcome.

What counts as "instantiated"
-----------------------------
A variable declaration -- `Foo: Codeunit "Bar"` -- because that is what resolves an
instance, and `Codeunit.Run(Codeunit::"Bar")`, because that executes Bar's OnRun.
`Codeunit::"Bar"` on its own is a compile-time object-id literal and reaches no
instance at all; several corpus tests use it to assert on metadata rows (object id
ordering, the `CodeUnit Metadata` SingleInstance column) and must not be reported.

Reachability is transitive: a test codeunit that runs a plain helper codeunit which
declares the fixture owns the fixture just as much as one naming it directly.

Preprocessor branches are not interpreted, matching check-object-ids.py. A fixture
reachable only under mutually exclusive `#if` branches would be reported falsely;
no corpus file does that today, and a loud false positive beats a silent miss.
