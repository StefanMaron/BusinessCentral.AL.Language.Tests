"""Fail when two SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN pull requests each claim the same AL object id.

Why this exists
---------------
`check-object-ids.py` validates one working tree: the pull request's own merge
commit. That catches a PR colliding with `master`, or with itself, and it is
blind by construction to every other open branch -- `actions/checkout` hands it
one tree and nothing else.

So two PRs can each add `codeunit 60940`, each pass, and break `master` on the
second merge. Branch protection's "require branches to be up to date" used to
close that window by forcing the second PR to rebase and recompile; turning it
off to let PRs drain without being serialized reopened it. This closes it
directly instead.

How
---
For each pull request, the ids it CLAIMS are the ids in its head tree minus the
ids already on `master`. An id both PRs merely inherit from `master` is not a
collision -- only ids each one introduces count. Two PRs collide when those two
claimed sets intersect.

The comparison runs in whichever PR's CI fires, so the collision is reported on
the PR itself within seconds of opening, on both PRs, and neither can merge
until one of them renumbers.

Modes
-----
  PR_NUMBER set   -- compare that PR against every other open PR (the CI case).
  PR_NUMBER unset -- compare every open PR against every other, pairwise. This
                     is what a push to `master` runs, so a collision that only
                     became reachable when master moved is still reported.

Requires GITHUB_TOKEN with `pull-requests: read`, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, and a
checkout deep enough to hold `master` (`fetch-depth: 0`).

Limitations, stated rather than hidden
--------------------------------------
* Draft PRs are included. A draft still claims ids and still merges eventually;
  excluding them would put the hole back for exactly the branches most likely to
  sit open long enough to collide.
* An abandoned-but-open PR blocks new PRs from reusing its ids. That is the
  intended direction of the tradeoff -- close the PR and the block lifts.
* A PR head that is behind `master` may show an id as "claimed" if `master` has
  since REMOVED that id. Rare, and it fails loud rather than silently passing.
* Preprocessor branches are not interpreted, same as the sibling script.

What this does NOT close
------------------------
A PR whose checks last ran before the colliding PR existed, and which never
pushes again, can still merge on a stale green -- GitHub does not re-run checks
on open PRs when master moves, and "require branches to be up to date" is off
here on purpose. The pairwise sweep on push to master reports that case, but
only as an annotation on the master run; nothing blocks the stale PR.

Closing it completely needs one of: turning the up-to-date requirement back on
(which serializes the queue again, the thing this replaced), or a job on push
to master that re-dispatches checks on every open PR. Until then, a PR that has
been open across several master merges is worth re-running before merging it.
