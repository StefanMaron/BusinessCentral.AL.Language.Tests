"""Fail the build when two AL objects of the same type share an ID, or when an
object's ID falls outside its app's declared idRanges.

Why this exists
---------------
Object IDs must be unique per object type across every app installed together,
and the AL compiler enforces that (AL0297) -- but only for the set of files it
is compiling at once. Two pull requests can each declare the SAME id, each
compile green in isolation, and break `master` the moment both are merged.
Neither PR's own CI can see the other.

That was previously caught only as a side effect of branch protection's
"require branches to be up to date" setting, which forced the second PR to be
rebased onto the first and recompiled. This check replaces that mechanism with
a direct one, so the collision is reported on the PR itself in seconds rather
than after a merge, and the up-to-date requirement is no longer load-bearing.

Two real near-misses that motivated it, both open at the same time:
  #113  codeunit 60909, page 60908
  #117  codeunit 60934, page 60909, table 60908
Those do NOT collide -- AL namespaces IDs per object type, so `page 60908` and
`table 60908` may coexist, as may `page 60909` and `codeunit 60909`. Checking
that by hand, per type, is exactly the error-prone step being automated here.

What counts as an object declaration
------------------------------------
A top-level `<type> <id> <name>` at the start of a line. Types that carry no
numeric ID (`interface`, `profile`, `controladdin`, `pagecustomization`,
`entitlement`) simply never match the pattern, so they need no special case.

Preprocessor branches are NOT interpreted. If an app ever declares the same
object twice under mutually exclusive `#if` branches, that is a legitimate
duplicate and this check would report it falsely -- at the time of writing no
file in the corpus does that (the only `#if` sits inside a codeunit body), and
the honest failure mode is a loud false positive rather than a silent miss.
