"""Self-test for check-singleinstance-fixture-owners.py -- AND the thing that runs it
against the real corpus.

Why both jobs live in one file
------------------------------
ci.yml discovers `.github/scripts/test-*.py` BY GLOB, so a suite named this way
gates from the day it lands with no workflow edit. Adding a separate, explicitly
named step for the checker would need one, and the account these agents push under
has no `workflow` OAuth scope -- the push is rejected outright. Rather than land a
checker that nothing runs, this suite ends by running it over the repository root.

The ordering matters and is deliberate: the synthetic scenarios run FIRST, so a
green on the corpus is only ever reported by a checker that has just demonstrated
it still detects, still ignores what it must ignore, and still refuses to pass
vacuously. A checker that silently stopped parsing AL would otherwise report OK on
the corpus for the same reason it reports OK on an empty tree.

The check's interesting path fires only when someone reintroduces a shared
SingleInstance fixture, which is exactly what nobody does on purpose. Left
untested it would sit in CI reporting OK whether or not it still parsed AL --
the shape of a check that has quietly stopped checking, and the shape this
whole area already produced once: eight green BC 28.x legs that measured
nothing because 60615 happened to run last (issue #261).

So this builds throwaway AL trees with known answers and asserts both
directions, including the three ways the check must NOT fire. No network,
about a second.
