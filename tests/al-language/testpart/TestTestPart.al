/// <summary>
/// CLAIM: TestPart is the TestPage-shaped handle a test gets when it reaches a `part()`
/// control through an open TestPage. Reading Ncl.dll, it looks like it should NOT be a thin
/// alias for TestPage -- NavTestPart overrides exactly two members, ALEnabled and ALVisible,
/// both reading the part CONTROL's own metadata, while everything else is inherited from the
/// base TestPage uses and reads the part PAGE.
///
/// A real service tier says that distinction is NOT OBSERVABLE FROM AL, and establishing
/// that is the main result of this file. The overrides exist, but every route to a control
/// whose Visible or Enabled would be false goes through a part that BC does not put in the
/// test page's control tree at all -- so AL cannot reach a handle on which either answers
/// false. Editable(), which is inherited rather than overridden, likewise does not follow the
/// host control's Editable property. All three were first written as PAIRS asserting the
/// opposite, and all 8 cloud legs falsified all three identically.
///
/// Nothing in this repository measured TestPart as a surface before this file. Searching the
/// suite for the type name -- with both `rg --hidden` and `command grep -rn`, which have
/// different silent-false-negative modes -- finds only the scraper scripts. Three of its 20
/// documented members (First, New, Next) are used INCIDENTALLY by other suites as a way to
/// reach rows while testing something else; the remaining 17 had no coverage at all, and
/// even those three were never asserted as claims about TestPart. docs/al-language-coverage-
/// gaps.md did not mention the type.
///
/// A note on the scraper: scripts/al-surface-inscope.json marks all 20 members "test-only".
/// That label is accurate here in a way it was NOT for SecretText, SessionSettings,
/// WebServiceActionContext or FilterPageBuilder -- TestPart genuinely only exists inside a
/// test. What it does not mean is "unreachable": a [Test] codeunit is exactly the context
/// this type is for, so the whole surface is measurable, and the label is not a reason to
/// skip it.
///
/// WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and what each test would catch if it broke:
///
///   1. A PART DECLARED Visible = false IS NOT IN THE TEST PAGE'S CONTROL TREE AT ALL.
///      Reaching it is a catchable error -- "The part with ID = <n> was not found on the
///      page." -- not a handle reporting false. Consequence: Visible() can never be observed
///      returning false from AL, and the same is true of Enabled() by the same route. Both
///      are pinned in the only two forms the tier permits: true for a reachable part, and
///      the error for an unreachable one. The error is asserted by SUBSTRING because the
///      message embeds a compiler-generated control id that differs per compilation.
///   2. Editable = false ON THE HOST'S PART CONTROL DOES NOT PROPAGATE TO Editable(). The
///      host hosts the SAME part page twice, once plainly and once with Editable = false, and
///      both report editable. The load-bearing assertion is the AreEqual stating the two
///      AGREE despite differing in the host property -- which is what an implementation
///      honoring that property would fail.
///   3. Caption() READS THE PART PAGE, NOT THE HOSTING CONTROL. Two hosts host one part page:
///      the default host's control carries no caption, the caption host's control overrides
///      it with a different string. Caption() answers the PART PAGE's caption from both. The
///      three strings involved -- host page caption, part page caption, control caption --
///      are deliberately all different, so the assertion cannot pass by two of them
///      coinciding. Ncl.dll settles the direction in advance (ALCaption is
///      `return TestPage.Caption`), and the pairing is what MEASURES it.
///   4. First()/Next()/Last()/Previous() WALK THE PART'S OWN ROWSET IN KEY ORDER. Asserted
///      over three seeded rows by reading a distinctive value at each stop, so an
///      implementation answering the first row for every position fails, and one answering
///      "there are rows" unconditionally fails the empty-part arm.
///   5. THE TWO ENDS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC, BECAUSE AN EDITABLE REPEATER CARRIES A TRAILING BLANK
///      NEW-ROW LINE. Previous() before the first row answers false and does not move. But
///      Next() past the last DATA row answers TRUE, stepping onto that blank line; only the
///      step after it answers false. So an editable part's rowset is one row longer than its
///      table. Read together with the empty-part arm -- where First() does NOT land on that
///      same blank line -- the trailing row is reachable by walking forward but is not a row
///      First() will find.
///   6. GoToKey() TAKES THE PRIMARY KEY FIELDS IN ORDER AND ITS ARITY IS CHECKED. The fixture
///      table's key is deliberately COMPOSITE (Grp + "Line No."), which is what makes the
///      negative case expressible at all: GoToKey with one value where two are required is a
///      catchable error, and the same call with the right arity lands on the row. Every other
///      part fixture in this repository keys on a single field, where a one-value GoToKey is
///      correct and the arity check is invisible.
///   7. GoToKey() RETURNS false FOR A KEY THAT DOES NOT EXIST WHEN THE RETURN VALUE IS
///      CAPTURED, AND ERRORS WHEN IT IS DISCARDED. The trappable-return convention, asserted
///      in both directions -- an implementation that always errors passes the discarded half,
///      one that never errors passes the captured half.
///   8. GoToRecord() POSITIONS FROM A Record RATHER THAN FROM KEY VALUES, AND AGREES WITH
///      GoToKey() ON THE SAME ROW. Asserted by landing on a row that is neither first nor
///      last, so an implementation ignoring its argument fails.
///   9. GetField(Id) TAKES A PAGE CONTROL ID, NOT A TABLE FIELD NUMBER. Passing a table field
///      number is refused with "The field with ID = <n> is not found on the page." Ncl.dll
///      shows this is by design and not a lookup that merely missed: GetField is
///      `fields.TryGetValue(id, ...)` over the page's own control dictionary, falling back to
///      the client control tree; table field numbers are keys in neither. Control ids are
///      compiler-generated per compilation, so no literal id is assertable here -- the test
///      pins the refusal, and asserts alongside it that the number passed IS a real table
///      field number, so it cannot pass merely because the number was meaningless.
///  10. FindFirstField()/FindNextField()/FindPreviousField() SEARCH THE ROWSET BY A CONTROL
///      VALUE. Two rows deliberately SHARE a Descr value while differing in key, so
///      FindFirstField lands on the earlier and FindNextField advances to the later; a third
///      row with a unique value is the negative case. An implementation that ignored the
///      value argument and simply moved would fail the row-identity assertions.
///  11. ValidationErrorCount() AND GetValidationError() REPORT ERRORS RAISED BY THE PART'S
///      OWN FIELD VALIDATION. The fixture table's Grade field refuses any value starting with
///      'BAD' with a Label the test asserts by substring, so the error counted is a REAL
///      validation error from the part's AL, not a platform type-conversion message whose
///      text is a localization detail. The clean-part arm asserts the count is 0, which is
///      what rules out an implementation that always reports one.
///  12. GetValidationError() IS 1-BASED AND RANGE-CHECKED. Index 1 is the first error and
///      index 0 errors. Ncl.dll shows why this is worth pinning rather than assuming:
///      ALGetValidationError(index) is literally
///      `TestPage.GetValidationError(checked(index - 1))` wrapped in a translation of
///      ArgumentOutOfRangeException, so the 1-based-ness is a deliberate offset applied at
///      the AL boundary and a 0-based implementation would be a silent off-by-one.
///
/// COMPILE-TIME REFUSALS, measured with the real alc against this app's Cloud target. These
/// are negative cases that CANNOT be written as [Test] procedures, because the compiler
/// rejects them before a service tier ever sees them. They are recorded here rather than
/// deleted, following the precedent of network/TestHttpClientBlockNoHandler.al:
///
///   Host.PartA = Host.PartB                     error AL0175: "Operator '=' cannot be applied
///                                               to operands of type 'Lines' and
///                                               'ReadOnlyLines'". Note WHAT that message
///                                               names: not "TestPart" but the two CONTROL
///                                               names. Each part control on a host is its
///                                               own generated type, which is the compiler's
///                                               view of the same fact the tests below rest
///                                               on -- a part handle is inseparable from the
