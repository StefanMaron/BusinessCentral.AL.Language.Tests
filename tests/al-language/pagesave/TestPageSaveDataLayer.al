/// <summary>
/// CLAIM: a row saved by a PAGE gets the same data-layer treatment as a row saved by
/// Record.Insert / Record.Modify. The AutoIncrement key is assigned, and SystemCreatedAt,
/// SystemCreatedBy, SystemModifiedAt and SystemModifiedBy are stamped -- by the platform, on
/// the page's own save path, with no AL anywhere assigning any of them.
///
/// The corpus already pins the two halves separately and neither covers this. `pageupdate`
/// (codeunit 60496) drives CurrPage.Update() and asserts TRIGGERS -- it never reads a stored
/// field. `record/TestBCSystemFieldContracts.al` (codeunit 60172) and
/// `record/TestAutoIncrementContracts.al` (codeunit 60201) read exactly these fields but only
/// ever through Record.Insert / Record.Modify -- neither file names TestPage at all. The
/// intersection, a system field or an AutoIncrement value on a row a PAGE saved, is what this
/// file measures.
///
/// WHY IT IS WORTH MEASURING: the page save is a different code path in the platform from the
/// AL record API, and everything read here is contributed by the data layer underneath both.
/// A platform that put the AutoIncrement assignment or the system-field stamp on the AL entry
/// point rather than in the data layer would answer correctly for Record.Insert and leave a
/// page-saved row with Entry No. = 0 and 0DT / null-guid system fields -- observably wrong, and
/// invisible to every test that writes through Record.Insert.
///
/// EACH TEST CARRIES ITS OWN CONTROL:
///
///   1. Every positive read is paired with a negative one -- a filter no row satisfies must
///      find nothing, so "the row exists" cannot be satisfied by a Get that answers true for
///      any key.
///   2. The record-API arm (RecordInsert_*) asserts the SAME values through Record.Insert. It
///      is what makes the claim "the data layer does this, whichever route reached it" rather
///      than "pages do something special".
///   3. The modify arm asserts that a page-driven Modify leaves SystemCreatedAt/SystemCreatedBy
///      exactly as the insert left them, to the MILLISECOND, and that a row the page never
///      opened keeps the SystemModifiedAt its own insert gave it. An implementation that re-ran
///      the INSERT stamp on the page's modify path fails the first; one that re-stamps every row
///      of the table on any save fails the second. What that arm deliberately does NOT assert,
///      and why no assertion there could be made to hold reliably, is written out at the test.
///
/// The AutoIncrement readings are asserted as "> 0" and as distinct between two rows, not as a
/// literal: which value the sequence is at is a property of the tier, not of the platform rule.

    // against a value captured before the page save. That assertion cannot fail. The row is
    // seeded by Record.Insert, so SystemModifiedAt is already a real instant before the page
    // touches it, and '>=' is satisfied by equality: a platform that stamped nothing at all on
    // the page's modify path passes it, and so does the companion AreNotEqual(0DT, ...). Both
    // were measured passing against a runner with the modify stamp disabled outright.
    //
    // Nothing was put in its place, and that is a finding rather than an omission. Every
    // replacement was measured and each failed for its own reason:
    //
    //   - A strict '>' on the same field. The gap between the seed insert and the page save is
    //     1-2 ms on a warm path -- measured 0 or 1 ms across ten iterations -- so the two writes
    //     routinely land in one millisecond. One formulation of this failed 3 times in 10 runs.
    //     A flaky corpus test is expensive well beyond this file.
    //   - Widening that gap with filler writes between the two. It does not widen: 40 inserts
    //     between the seed and the page save still left 0-1 ms, because the cost is in the page
    //     machinery either side, not between them.
    //   - Two consecutive page saves, comparing the second against the first. Worse -- the
    //     second save is the faster one, and the two collided 9 times in 16.
    //   - SystemRowVersion instead, which is clock-free and advanced on 16 of 16 page saves.
    //     But it advances on the page save whatever the system-field stamp did: it was measured
    //     advancing on all 8 iterations against the same disabled-stamp platform above. It
    //     pins "the write reached the data layer", not "the field was re-stamped".
    //   - SystemModifiedBy, which the platform writes beside SystemModifiedAt. In a
    //     single-user test it holds the same user GUID before and after, so it cannot move.
    //
    // So the re-stamp of SystemModifiedAt is not observable from this codeunit's shape without
    // depending on how fast the tier is. It is left unasserted rather than asserted vacuously.
    //
    // WHAT IT DOES CLAIM IS NOW MEASURED TO THE MILLISECOND. Assert.AreEqual/AreNotEqual compare
    // non-numeric variants as Format(_, 0, 2), which for a DateTime renders to the MINUTE --
    // '09/20/26 01:10 PM'. Measured: a page save 171 ms after its seed insert compared EQUAL
    // through Assert while the raw AL '<>' on those two values answered true. So
    // 'SystemCreatedAt must NOT change' would have held even if SystemCreatedAt had moved by
    // most of a minute. The DateTime comparisons below go through Format(_, 0, 9), the
    // round-trip form ('2026-09-20T11:10:12.851Z'), which carries milliseconds; the claim is
    // unchanged and the resolution is three orders of magnitude finer.
