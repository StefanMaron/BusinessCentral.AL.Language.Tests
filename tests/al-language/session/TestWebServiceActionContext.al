/// <summary>
/// CLAIM: WebServiceActionContext is a mutable in-memory value object that an API page action
/// fills in to tell the OData layer what it did -- which object to redirect to, which entity
/// row, and what HTTP status to report. Its whole 7-method surface is get/set pairs plus one
/// collection-add, so ALL of it is observable from a plain [Test] with no web service request
/// in flight. The type is what an action WRITES; a web service client is only what eventually
/// READS it, and nothing in the write path needs a client attached.
///
/// Nothing in this repository measured any part of WebServiceActionContext before this file.
/// docs/al-language-coverage-gaps.md lists it under gap #5 as "no test file at all; the least-
/// covered remaining candidate", and searching the suite for the type name finds only that doc
/// and the scraper scripts. Note that scripts/al-surface-inscope.json labels all 7 members
/// "out-of-scope" -- that label is wrong in the same way it was wrong for SecretText (now a
/// merged suite) and SessionSettings (now 31 passing tests): it classifies by the type's NAME
/// rather than by what the members actually do.
///
/// WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and what each test would catch if it broke:
///
///   1. ROUND-TRIPPING, WITH DISTINCTIVE VALUES. SetObjectId/GetObjectId and
///      SetObjectType/GetObjectType read back exactly what was written. Every value asserted
///      here is deliberately NOT the type's default -- never object id 0, never the unnamed
///      zero-valued object type -- so an implementation that ignores its argument and returns
///      a default fails rather than passing by coincidence.
///   2. THE PROPERTIES ARE INDEPENDENT, AND LAST-WRITE-WINS. Setting the object type must not
///      disturb the object id and vice versa; a second write to either must replace the first.
///      An implementation backing both with one field, or accepting only a first value, fails.
///   3. THE RESULT-CODE ROUND TRIP IS LOSSY, AND THIS IS THE REASON THE FILE IS WORTH HAVING.
///      GetResultCode() does NOT always return the member that was passed to SetResultCode().
///      WebServiceActionResultCode declares FIVE members over FOUR distinct values --
///      None = 0, Get = 200, Created = 201, Updated = 200, Deleted = 204 -- so Get and Updated
///      are the SAME underlying value. The platform stores the code by converting the name to
///      a second, separately-declared enum and reads it back by converting the name again, so
///      the pair collapses onto whichever name is declared first. Setting Updated therefore
///      reads back as Get. Tests below assert BOTH directions of that collision: the three
///      unambiguous members survive the round trip unchanged, and Updated does not. An
///      implementation that stored the AL enum member verbatim -- the obvious and otherwise
///      indistinguishable implementation -- passes every other test in this file and fails
///      exactly this one.
///   4. AddEntityKey OBEYS THE TRAPPABLE-RETURN CONVENTION IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. Adding a key
///      for a field id already present is an error, because the keys are a map keyed by field
///      id rather than a list. Like Record.Insert and its siblings, the method reports that
///      failure two different ways depending on whether the caller captures the return value:
///      captured, it returns false; not captured, it raises a catchable error naming the type.
///      Both are asserted, so an implementation that always throws, always returns true, or
///      silently overwrites the existing key fails.
///   5. Clear() RESETS THE WHOLE INSTANCE. Clear() replaces the underlying context, so the
///      object id, the object type and the result code all return to their defaults AND the
///      entity keys are emptied -- the last of which is asserted indirectly, by re-adding a
///      field id that had already been used and observing that it now succeeds. An
///      implementation that reset only the scalar properties fails that one.
///   6. ASSIGNMENT COPIES THE REFERENCE, NOT THE VALUE. This is the second surprise, and it is
///      the OPPOSITE of SessionSettings, where `A := B` deep-copies. Two AL variables assigned
///      from one another share a single underlying context, so mutating one is visible through
///      the other. Asserted explicitly rather than assumed, since the intuition carried over
///      from SessionSettings is wrong here.
///
/// DEFAULTS ARE PINNED SEPARATELY, and deliberately: a fresh instance reports object id 0,
/// WebServiceActionResultCode::None, and an object type that is none of the seven members AL
/// can name. Those assertions are what make the round-trip tests above meaningful -- they
/// establish that the values the other tests assert are genuinely different from what an
/// untouched instance answers, so none of those tests can pass by coincidence.
///
/// THE COMPILE-TIME SURFACE WAS MEASURED with the AL compiler (v17.0.34.45391) against this
/// app's Cloud target, and two refusals are worth writing down because they shape the tests:
///
///     if C1 = C2 then                error AL0175: operator '=' cannot be applied to operands
///                                    of type 'WebServiceActionContext' and
///                                    'WebServiceActionContext'
///     if R1 = R2 then                error AL0175: the same, for two operands of type
///                                    'WebServiceActionResultCode' -- so the result code is
///                                    compared here through Assert.AreEqual, which takes
///                                    Variants, rather than with `=`
///     I := ResultCode.AsInteger();   error AL0132: 'WebServiceActionResultCode' does not
///                                    contain a definition for 'AsInteger'. It is a platform
///                                    enum, not an AL enum object, so the AsInteger/AsEnum
///                                    pair does not exist on it and its numeric value cannot
///                                    be read from AL at all. This is why test 3 pins the
///                                    Get/Updated collision by NAME through Assert.AreEqual
///                                    rather than by comparing 200 to 200, which would prove
///                                    nothing anyway.
///     V := Ctx;  T := Format(Ctx);   BOTH COMPILE -- unlike SecretText, this type converts to
///                                    Variant and has a text representation.
///     Ctx := SomeVariant;            error AL0122: Cannot implicitly convert type 'Variant'
///                                    to 'WebServiceActionContext'. The Variant conversion is
///                                    ONE-DIRECTIONAL -- in, not out.
///     Clear(Ctx);                    COMPILES.
///
/// Because `=` is refused on both types, there is no compile-time-refusal test in this file:
/// a refusal is a compiler diagnostic, not a runtime error, so `asserterror` has nothing to
/// catch and a test asserting it could never fail. The refusals are recorded above instead of
/// being fabricated into tests, following network/TestHttpClientBlockNoHandler.al.
///
/// THE DEFAULT OBJECT TYPE CANNOT BE NAMED IN AL, and this shaped two tests. AL's ObjectType
/// exposes exactly SEVEN members -- Table, Page, Report, Codeunit, XmlPort, Query, MenuSuite
/// (measured: every other spelling tried, including TableData, Enum, Interface, PermissionSet,
/// ControlAddIn, PageExtension and None, is error AL0132). The platform enum behind it is
/// NavObjectType, which starts at TableData = 0 and also carries Form = 2 and Enum = 10 --
/// values AL has no expression for. A pristine context's object type is that unnamed zero, so
/// no assertion here can say what it IS. Two tests state it the way it can honestly be stated:
/// a fresh context differs from all seven assignable members, and Clear() returns the type to
/// whatever a second, never-touched context reports. Both are relative claims, in the same
/// spirit as the Init()/Company handling in session/TestSessionSettings.al, and both still
/// fail against an implementation that defaulted to a nameable member or ignored Clear.
///
/// DELIBERATELY NOT TESTED: the OData/web-service side of the contract -- that a real API page
/// action returning this context actually makes the platform emit HTTP 201 and a redirect to
/// the named entity. That needs a web service request against a published API page, which is
/// outside what a [Test] codeunit can provoke and outside this repository's Cloud-safe runtime
/// focus. Everything asserted here is the AL-observable half: what the action writes, which is
/// the half AL code is responsible for.
///
/// SIDE EFFECTS: none. Every test operates on a local WebServiceActionContext variable that
/// lives and dies inside the test method. Nothing is written to the tenant, so these tests are
/// order-independent and safe to run alongside the rest of the suite.
