// BC Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-types#virtual-tables
// Scope: in-scope
// Fixtures used: Assert only. The subject is a platform virtual table (Session,
//                2000000009) and the session doing the reading; nothing is created,
//                nothing is written, and no fixture object is involved.
//
// CLAIM: the Session virtual table is a view of the session doing the reading. The
// platform's identity surfaces -- SessionId(), UserId() -- and the row in this table are
// the same facts, so they cannot disagree; and there is a row at all, which is the half a
// host that keeps session identity only in memory can silently fail.
//
// Session is Scope = Cloud and is NOT one of the platform's internal tables, so a
// Target = Cloud app can name it directly. No RecordRef escape hatch is needed and none is
// used.
//
// EVERY ASSERTION IS ABOUT SHAPE OR ABOUT AGREEMENT, NEVER ABOUT A LITERAL. The connection
// id, the user name, the host name and the login instant are properties of the environment
// this runs in, so pinning any of them would fail for reasons that are configuration rather
// than platform behavior. Comparing the table against SessionId() / UserId() instead is the
// stronger claim anyway: it is the one a value invented by the host cannot satisfy.

    // table answers "who am I" and never "who else is here".
