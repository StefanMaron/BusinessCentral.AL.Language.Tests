// Scope: in-scope (Cloud-compatible)
// Fixtures used: none; shared Assert (60021)

//
/// <summary>
/// CLAIM: SessionSettings is a mutable value object describing a session's personalization --
/// company, language, locale, time zone and profile. Its accessors are get/set pairs on an
/// in-memory instance, so all of them are observable from a test WITHOUT a client attached.
/// Nothing in this repository measured any part of SessionSettings before this file --
/// docs/al-language-coverage-gaps.md lists it first under gap #4, "partial or thin coverage",
/// and a search of the suite finds no other reference to the type.
///
/// WHAT IS PINNED HERE, and what each test would catch if it broke:
///
///   1. ROUND-TRIPPING. Each accessor is a get/set pair: the value written is the value read
///      back. Every such test writes a DISTINCTIVE value and asserts that exact value, so an
///      implementation returning a constant, or returning the live session's value instead of
///      the assigned one, fails.
///   2. THE ACCESSORS ARE INDEPENDENT. Setting one property must not disturb another. Tests
///      set several properties to different values and assert all of them afterwards, so an
///      implementation backing two properties with one field fails.
///   3. ProfileSystemScope IGNORES ITS ARGUMENT. This is the surprising one, and it is the
///      reason this file is worth having. System profiles are deprecated -- all profiles are
///      tenant-scoped -- so the setter accepts `true` and stores `false` regardless. An
///      implementation that treated it as an ordinary Boolean get/set pair would pass every
///      other test in this file and fail this one.
///   4. ASSIGNMENT COPIES BY VALUE. `A := B` deep-copies the settings. Mutating the copy
///      afterwards must not change the original. An implementation sharing one underlying
///      object between both variables fails.
///   5. Init() POPULATES THE INSTANCE, DETERMINISTICALLY. Init() fills the instance from the
///      current user's personalization, falling back to live session values when there is no
///      stored row. An initialized instance cannot equal a pristine one, two instances
///      initialized in the same session agree, and values assigned beforehand are replaced.
///      All three are asserted RELATIVELY -- against another instance -- never against a
///      hard-coded company or language, which are tenant data rather than AL. See the
///      MEASURED note below for why that distinction is not hypothetical.
///   6. RequestSessionUpdate() IS A UI INTERACTION requiring a [SessionSettingsHandler], like
///      a Message requires a MessageHandler. The handler is invoked exactly once, receives the
///      settings that were assigned, and the call leaves the instance intact and does not
///      retroactively change the running session's language -- it is a request for a FUTURE
///      session. The handler-invocation COUNT is asserted, so a call that silently did
///      nothing would fail rather than pass as a no-throw.
///
/// NEGATIVE CASES ARE COMPILE-TIME, NOT RUNTIME, AND THERE ARE FEWER THAN EXPECTED. There is
/// no documented runtime error on this type that a Cloud test can provoke with `asserterror`:
/// the setters are plain assignments on an in-memory object, and the documented failures --
/// Company() naming a company that does not exist, ProfileId() naming a profile absent from
/// table 2000000072 -- are raised by the client round-trip on session update, not by the
/// setter. So this file deliberately contains NO `asserterror` test rather than inventing one
/// that cannot fail. Setting a nonexistent company is instead asserted below to be accepted by
/// the SETTER, which is the observable half of that contract.
///
/// The compile-time surface was MEASURED with the AL compiler (v17.0.34.45391) against this
/// app's Cloud target, and it refuses less than a SecretText-style type would -- worth writing
/// down, because the intuition carried over from SecretText is wrong here:
///
///     if S1 = S2 then              error AL0175: operator '=' cannot be applied to operands
///                                  of type 'SessionSettings' and 'SessionSettings'
///     V := Settings;               COMPILES -- unlike SecretText, SessionSettings converts to
///                                  Variant
///     Assert.AreEqual(S1, S2, '')  COMPILES, and is therefore a real runtime assertion. Assert
///                                  falls through to Format(_, 0, 2) for non-primitive
///                                  variants, so comparing two settings objects compares their
///                                  formatted values. Pinned below.
///     T := Format(Settings);       COMPILES -- a settings object has a text representation
///     Clear(Settings);             COMPILES
///
/// The [SessionSettingsHandler] signature is fixed by the platform and enforced by the
/// compiler -- writing it without a return value is error AL0244, which names the required
/// shape: SessionSettingsHandler(var SessionSettings: SessionSettings): Boolean
///
/// MEASURED ON REAL BC, AND IT CHANGED THIS FILE. The first CI run of this suite (16 legs)
/// falsified two assumptions that had looked safe, and both corrections are the reason the
/// tests above are shaped the way they are:
///
///   * Init() DOES NOT ALWAYS RESOLVE A COMPANY. On BC 27.5 (cloud) Init() leaves Company
///     EMPTY; on 28.0-28.4 it is populated. Whether a company is resolved depends on the User
///     Personalization row and the session's company -- tenant data, not AL. So no assertion
///     here pins Company to a value after Init(); the version-independent claims (it changes a
///     pristine instance, it is repeatable, it overwrites prior values) are pinned instead.
///   * RequestSessionUpdate() NEEDS A HANDLER. Without one it fails with
///     "Unhandled UI: SessionSettings". It is genuinely a client interaction, and the platform
///     routes it through NavTestExecution.TestHandleSessionSettings, which looks up a
///     NavHandlerType.SessionSettings handler and falls through to the client callback when
///     none is registered. The four tests above therefore declare [SessionSettingsHandler] and
///     assert that it really fires. This is the one place the "UI-level" label on this type is
///     accurate -- and it applies to this single method, not to the other eight.
///
/// DELIBERATELY NOT TESTED: RequestSessionUpdate(true). The `true` argument makes the platform
/// WRITE the settings to table 2000000073 "User Personalization" for the running user before
/// sending the client request. That is a durable side effect on the tenant the suite runs
/// against, outside this codeunit's own fixtures, and it would change the values a later
/// Init() reads -- so exercising it could make the Init() tests above order-dependent. Only
/// the non-persisting direction is exercised here; the persisting one needs a fixture that can
/// restore the user's personalization afterwards.
///
/// The AL compiler also independently confirms the ProfileSystemScope claim above. Referencing
/// it raises AL0667 with Microsoft's own wording: "System profiles have been deprecated. All
/// profiles are now in the Tenant. Setting this value to true has no effect." That warning is
/// expected on every build of this file and is not a defect; the suite carries comparable
/// deprecation warnings for IsServiceTier and OptionString elsewhere.
