//
// What a TestPage control whose declared type is DateFormula does with the value SetValue
// hands it. AL's TestPage surface is string-typed for every control, so the question the tier
// answers here is whether a DateFormula control EVALUATES that string into a date formula, or
// whether the value has to already be one.
//
// Both ways an AL test can reach a DateFormula control are covered, because they are different
// code paths and a platform can get one right and the other wrong:
//
//   Shape A — the AL hands SetValue a TEXT that spells a formula ('<1D>', '3D').
//   Shape B — the AL hands SetValue a typed DateFormula, via a Variant. BC renders the typed
//             value to text before the control sees it, so this arm pins that the round trip
//             through that rendering still lands on the control's declared type.
//
// Both bindings are covered for the same reason: RecPeriod is bound to a table field,
// VarPeriod to a page variable, and BC's write path reaches them differently.
//
// The two Text arms are the control: they pin that a control whose type is NOT DateFormula
// still takes its string unchanged. An implementation that routed every control through
// DateFormula evaluation would pass every arm above and fail those two, which is what makes
// this suite discriminate rather than merely cover.
//
// The last arm is the negative direction, and it is deliberately NOT "an invalid value is
// refused". That was measured and is false: BC's DateFormula parser reads a leading token and
// stops, so 'not a formula' and '<1X>' are both accepted rather than rejected. What the arm
// pins instead is that two formulas differing ONLY in the quantifier do not land on the same
// stored value -- which is what fails if a platform stores the text verbatim, truncates it,
// or blanks it, and which needs no prediction of the tier's own formatting.
