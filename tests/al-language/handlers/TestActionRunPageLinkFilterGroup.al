/// <summary>
/// Pins WHICH filter group an ACTION's RunPageLink filters land in on the opened page's Rec.
///
/// This is the sibling of TestPagePartLinkFilterGroup.al, which pins the same question for a
/// part's SubPageLink (group 4, "Link"). Nothing upstream covers the action/RunPageLink side:
/// no corpus file mentions RunPageLink and FilterGroup together.
///
/// MEASURED, and it is NOT the same group as SubPageLink. Real BC puts the filter in
/// FilterGroup(0):
///
///     g0=AAA|g2=|g4=          (8 cloud legs, corpus run 34930362542)
///
/// That is worth pinning precisely because the analogy tempts the other answer. A part's
/// SubPageLink lands in group 4 ("Link") and Base Application reads it back with
/// Rec.FilterGroup(4) -- see TestPagePartLinkFilterGroup.al. An action's RunPageLink does not
/// follow that pattern, so code that assumes symmetry between the two is wrong about one of
/// them.
///
/// Written for AL Runner issue StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.AL.Runner#4160, which predicted
/// group 4 by that analogy and said plainly it had not checked which group the compiler writes
/// on RunFormLink.TableFilters. It had not, and the prediction was wrong: the runner's existing
/// behaviour (filters in the current group, 0) already matches BC.
///
/// THE PROBE READS THREE GROUPS and both arms assert all three in ONE string, so a failure
/// names the group that actually holds the filter rather than only reporting that the expected
/// one does not. The first version of these arms asserted each group separately, which stopped
/// at the first failure and could not say where the filter had gone -- the question the test
/// exists to answer.
