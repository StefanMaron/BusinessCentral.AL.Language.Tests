// Fixtures used: SPV Row (60979), SPV Host (60983), SPV Filtered Part (60986),

//
/// <summary>
/// Pins that a part's SubPageView filters the rows the part shows.
///
/// SubPageView is the sibling of SubPageLink on the same part definition: the link ties the part
/// to the host's current row, the view is a standing filter and sort order declared on the part
/// itself. The corpus covers SubPageLink (TestPagePartLinkFilterGroup.al,
/// TestPageSubpagePartConstFilter.al) and mentions SubPageView nowhere.
///
/// Written for AL Runner issue StefanMaron/BusinessCentral.AL.Runner#4188, which measures the
/// runner reading SubPageLink at 136 sites under AlRunner/ and SubPageView at ZERO -- so a part
/// declaring a view is expected to show rows the view excludes. Nothing here predicts the
/// runner's answer.
///
/// TWO PARTS ON THE ONE HOST, and the pair is the design. Both are bound to the same table and
/// the same rows; only one declares a SubPageView. So:
///   - the filtered part showing only matching rows, AND the open part showing all of them,
///     together say the view filtered rather than something else having emptied the part;
///   - the filtered part showing ALL rows says the view was ignored -- the #4188 shape;
///   - both parts showing nothing says the fixture never seeded, and neither arm above means
///     anything.
/// A single part could not separate the second case from the third.
///
/// A THIRD ARM pins which FILTER GROUP the view's filter lands in: group 4, the same Link group
/// a part's SubPageLink uses. That was measured, not inferred -- BC's own
/// NavForm.ApplySourceTableView uses group 2, and predicting 4-vs-2 from that IL would have been
/// wrong, because that method applies a PAGE's own SourceTableView and Ncl.dll declares no
/// member referencing SubFormView at all.
///
/// BOTH ARMS WALK THE PART WITH First/Next AND ASSERT WHICH ENTRIES APPEAR, rather than
/// counting rows to a total. An editable ListPart shows a trailing blank new row, so a count
/// measures n+1 (BC answered 5 for four seeded rows, and the blank row's empty Bucket read as a
/// view violation). Asserting entry numbers is also stronger than a count: it says the filtered
/// part skips entry 2 specifically, and the control part reaches it.
