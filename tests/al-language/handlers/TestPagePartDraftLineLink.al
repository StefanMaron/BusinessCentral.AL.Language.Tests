/// <summary>
/// Pins what happens when a test types into the implicit DRAFT LINE of a subpage part that
/// carries a SubPageLink -- the blank row an editable, insert-allowed repeater always shows
/// past its data.
///
/// Two suites already surround this and neither answers it. Codeunit 60743 ("Test Page New
/// Row Line Tests") measured the draft line itself: Next() past the last data row lands on
/// it, it reads blank, walking onto it and leaving it alone writes nothing, and typing into
/// an empty editable list with no New() and no First() still inserts a row -- all on a
/// STANDALONE page with no link. Codeunit 60648 ("PKFL Tests") measured what New() stamps
/// through a linked part, and pinned the primary-key gate BC applies there.
///
/// The gap is the intersection: a part that is BOTH linked AND written through its draft
/// line. That is the single commonest shape in Microsoft's own test code --
///
///     SalesQuote.OpenNew();
///     SalesQuote."Sell-to Customer Name".SetValue(Customer.Name);
///     SalesQuote.SalesLines.First();                    // no lines yet
///     SalesQuote.SalesLines."No.".SetValue(Item."No."); // types into the draft line
///
/// -- and the line table's first OnValidate immediately reads the document key it was linked
/// on. If the draft line does not carry that key by the time the trigger runs, the write
/// fails on the key rather than on anything the test is about.
///
/// THE CLAIMS
///   * Reading the draft line answers with the SubPageLink's value in the linked column, and
///     blank elsewhere. This is the one claim in the file that a service tier corrected: it was
///     written as "blank in the linked column too" and all 8 BC legs answered 'H1'
///     (run 33995429394). The linked field is the first field of the line table's primary key,
///     which is exactly the set RecordImplementation.InitRecordFromFilters copies a filter
///     onto -- so the client fills the blank line's key from the part's own filter. Codeunit
///     60648 "PKFL Tests" shows the other side: a link on a NON-key field leaves it blank
///     there.
///   * Writing to it does go through that step: the row that appears carries the link's
///     value, and the typed field's OnValidate ALREADY SEES it. "Header Seen By Validate" is
///     what separates those two -- a row whose key were stamped after the validate would
///     still finish with the right "Header No." while that field stayed blank.
///   * The same holds when the draft line was reached by walking off the end of existing
///     data (First() then Next()), not only when the part opened empty, and when nothing
///     positioned the part at all.
///   * The step that creates it is the platform's own new-record step, not a bare insert: the
///     part page's OnNewRecord trigger runs for a row started on the draft line exactly as it
///     does for New(). "Set By OnNewRecord" is the witness.
///   * A promoted draft line does not collide with the rows already there: AutoSplitKey runs
///     for it, so its "Line No." lands past the last existing line rather than at 0.
///   * Walking onto the draft line of a linked part and leaving it untouched still writes
///     nothing -- the linked case of what codeunit 60743 pins unlinked.
///
/// The negative is in the data: a second header carries its own line, so a part that ignores
/// the link, or writes through the wrong one, shows or touches a row the assertions name.
