// Scope: in-scope
// Fixtures used: MRL Row (60400), MRL Probe (60401), MRL Modal Card (60402), Assert
//
// Pins that a page opened modally ON A ROW THE CALLER ALREADY POSITIONED — the
// `PAGE.RunModal(id, Rec)` shape — still raises its OnAfterGetRecord for that row before the
// [ModalPageHandler] gets to read anything.
//
// The two halves are one claim and have to be asserted together, because a plausible
// implementation gets each one right on its own and both wrong together:
//
//   * the trigger must FIRE (a page whose per-row state is derived in OnAfterGetRecord shows
//     nothing at all otherwise), and
//   * it must fire for the CALLER'S row, not for whatever sorts first (re-querying the table
//     to get a row to load is not the same thing, and would silently move the page off the
//     row the caller opened it on).
//
// The fixture is built so those two cannot both pass by accident: two rows exist, and the
// caller deliberately opens the page on the SECOND one. A page that never load-triggers
// writes no probe row; a page that re-queries writes the first row's; only loading the
// caller's row writes 'B'.
//
// Deliberately NOT in OnOpenPage: when a page is opened modally and handed to a handler,
// OnOpenPage and OnAfterGetRecord are reached by different mechanisms, and this suite is
// about the row-load one. Prompted by AlRunner#2797, where Base Application page 403
// "Purchase Order Statistics" — which computes every total it shows in OnAfterGetRecord and
// nothing in OnOpenPage — displayed zeros for exactly this reason.
