/// <summary>
/// Pins HOW MANY TIMES a subpage part's OnNewRecord trigger runs -- the question codeunit 60996
/// ("TPDL Tests") leaves open, and cannot answer with the witness it uses.
///
/// WHY THE EXISTING SUITE CANNOT ANSWER IT. 60996 measured, on all 8 BC legs, that the draft
/// line of a linked part has ALREADY run the page's OnNewRecord before anyone types into it
/// (LinkedPart_DraftLine_HasRunTheOnNewRecordTrigger, run 33997895349). Its witness is
/// `Rec."Set By OnNewRecord" := 'NEWREC'`, and an assignment is idempotent: one firing, two
/// firings and five firings all leave 'NEWREC' in the field. So every arm of that file passes
/// whether the platform raises the trigger once per row or repeatedly, and the same is true of
/// any OnNewRecord that only assigns defaults -- which is what most real ones do.
///
/// That matters as soon as an OnNewRecord has a SIDE EFFECT rather than only a default: a
/// number-series draw, a log row, a counter, a call out to a setup codeunit. Repeated firings
/// silently multiply it, and nothing in the finished row says so.
///
/// WHAT REAL BC ANSWERED, and it is not "once" -- nor is it one number. This file was first
/// written asserting one firing per row throughout. A real service tier said otherwise,
/// identically on all 8 cloud legs of run 34140530877 (BC 27.0 through 28.4):
///
///   * opening the card on an EMPTY part and landing on its draft line cost SIX firings;
///   * New() on that same empty part cost SEVEN -- the six above, plus one for New() itself.
///
/// Those six and seven were then pinned here as exact constants, described as deterministic
/// platform behaviour. THAT WAS WRONG, and a second real tier is what showed it. The official
/// Microsoft BC container on Windows, BC 28.4, nightly run 34182689878, answers THREE and FOUR
/// for the same two arms (corpus issue #281).
///
/// So the absolute count is a property of the TIER, not of the platform, and this file no
/// longer asserts one. What differs between the two tiers is how many blank rows the client
/// renders to fill the viewport, which is exactly what the mechanism below predicts would vary.
///
/// WHAT IS ASSERTED INSTEAD, and why nothing is weakened by it. Every claim this file exists to
/// make is a DELTA, and both tiers agree on all of them:
///
///   * landing on an existing data row costs 0, and Next() onto the draft line costs exactly 1
///     (arm 4, absolute and portable, because it never renders an empty repeater);
///   * First() on an ALREADY-open empty part costs exactly 0 more -- the draft line was
///     started during the open (arm 1);
///   * New() on an empty part costs exactly +1 over the open (arm 3);
///   * writing into a draft line already started costs exactly +0 (arms 2 and 5);
///   * a second row started through the draft line costs exactly +1 (arm 5).
///
/// Those are exact integers, so an implementation that fires an extra time still fails and one
/// that stops firing still fails. The single non-exact assertion in the file is arm 1's "the
/// open cost is greater than zero", which is the honest portable form of "showing a blank draft
/// line raises the trigger at all": the tier decides how many times, and both measured tiers
/// agree that it is more than once.
///
/// THE MECHANISM the numbers point at, stated as the reading it is: showing a blank draft line
/// in an EMPTY repeater raises the trigger repeatedly as the client fills the visible viewport,
/// whereas a row that genuinely starts adds exactly one. Arm 4 is what makes that reading
/// falsifiable rather than decorative -- on a part that already HAS a row, opening costs zero
/// (landing on real data is not a new record) and walking onto the draft line with Next() costs
/// exactly one. So the six is a property of rendering an empty repeater, not a per-row cost.
///
/// HOW THE LATER ASSERTIONS IN EACH ARM ARE WRITTEN, and why they are not absolute integers.
/// Run 34140530877 failed each arm at its FIRST count assertion, so only that first number was
/// measured; every count after it in the same arm never executed. Rather than invent absolutes
/// that no tier has confirmed, each arm now captures the measured baseline in a variable and
/// asserts the exact DELTA from it -- +0 for a step that must not start a record, +1 for a step
/// that starts exactly one. The deltas are exact integers, so nothing here is weakened to a
/// range or an inequality: an implementation that fires an extra time fails, and one that stops
/// firing fails too.
///
/// THE ARMS, and what each isolates.
///
///   1. DraftLine_Shown  -- land on the draft line and touch nothing. Counts what merely SHOWING
///      the blank line costs. Measured: 6.
///   2. DraftLine_Written -- land on the draft line and write one field. Arm 2's delta over
///      arm 1's baseline answers "does the write start the record a second time".
///   3. New_OnEmptyPart  -- New() on an empty part. Measured: 7, i.e. arm 1's six plus one.
///   4. DraftLine_ReachedByNext -- the control, and the arm that passed unchanged. A part with
///      existing data: opening costs 0, Next() onto the draft line costs 1. This is what keeps
///      the sixes above attributable to the empty-repeater render rather than to counting at all.
///
/// The negative is in the data: a second header carries its own line, so an implementation that
/// ignores the SubPageLink shows a row it should not, and the counts move.
