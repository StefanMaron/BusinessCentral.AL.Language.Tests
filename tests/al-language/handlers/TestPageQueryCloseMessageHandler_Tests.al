//
// The arm "QCE Query Close Error Tests" (60677) deliberately left out, named in its own header:
// the same failing OnQueryClosePage, but with a [MessageHandler] DECLARED.
//
// Why it is a separate question. Closing a page is a client round trip, and the platform's close
// handler classifies what the trigger raised. An AL Error() is none of its named cases, so it
// reaches the general one, which shows the text as a MESSAGE and then refuses the close. With no
// [MessageHandler] declared that refusal is invisible, because showing the message is itself what
// fails -- the framework raises its own "Unhandled UI: Message ..." from inside the show call and
// nothing after it runs. That is what 60677 pins.
//
// Declare a [MessageHandler] and the show call SUCCEEDS. The handler consumes the text, control
// returns to the close handler, and only now does the "refuse the close" half become reachable at
// all. So this suite asks the three things nobody has measured:
//
//   1. does the caller get control back, or does the refusal surface as an error?
//   2. if it returns, what does RunModal() report?
//   3. what became of the page, and of the writes it made?
//
// Run order is deliberate. The negative control is first, and every assertion below is written so
// that "the handler never ran" and "the handler ran and the close was refused" cannot produce the
// same verdict -- an implementation that simply swallows the close-time error, or one that never
// dispatches the handler, fails a named assertion rather than passing quietly.
//
// Filed from AlRunner#3179, split out of AlRunner#3057.

    // No [MessageHandler] is declared, and that is deliberate rather than an omission: the

    // ("The following UI handlers were not executed"), so a control whose whole point is that no
    // message is sent CANNOT declare one. The claim "a successful close sends no message" is
    // therefore carried by 60677's own negative control plus the arms below, which show the
    // message appearing only once the trigger fails.
