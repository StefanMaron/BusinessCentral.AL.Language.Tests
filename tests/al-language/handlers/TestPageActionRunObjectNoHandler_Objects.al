// Fixtures used: TPARONH Row (60280), TPARONH Card Target (60281),
//                TPARONH Logging Target (60282), TPARONH Host (60283), TPARONH Log (60284),

// Fixtures for "what does a RunObject action do when no handler is bound". The answer these
// were built to find is recorded in TestPageActionRunObjectNoHandler_Tests.al: the target page
// opens unattended, and AL is never told.
//
// These duplicate the shape of the TPARO fixtures rather than reusing them, on purpose. This
// change sat open while that question was unsettled, and the corpus gate that matters here
// compares the object ids a pull request INTRODUCES against every other open pull request.
// Sharing the TPARO objects would have meant claiming their ids too, which collides with the
// change that introduces them and blocks both. A self-contained fixture set also means these
// tests keep compiling and keep measuring exactly what they measured on the day the answer was
// recorded, whatever happens to the TPARO suite.

// A SECOND record of the same event as the TPARONH Log row, kept in memory instead of the

//
// Arm 6 asks whether a REFUSED Page.Run opened its target. The refusal raises an error, and
// that error -- measured on all eight cloud legs, see the note on arm 6 -- discards the
// uncommitted rows of the transaction it unwinds. So on that one arm a missing 'OPENED' row
// means nothing: it is missing whether the page opened or not. Every other arm reads the log
// table happily, because no error is involved.
//
// SingleInstance codeunit state is memory, not database, so no rollback can reach it. That is
// the same reason ASK Probe (60917) exists for its own suite. Reset() is called from the
// tests' Initialize(), so each arm starts from a known state.
