// Does the validation error a PAGE-GLOBAL control records carry the client's
// " (Select Refresh to discard errors)" suffix, the way a REC-BOUND control's does?
//
// This asks one question, and it is asked because two pieces of evidence point opposite ways.
//
//   * Run 34002487601 (PR #182, codeunit 60836) measured a REC-BOUND control on all reporting
//     legs. Its OnValidate raised `Error('Deliberate OnValidate failure for VAL-1')` and
//     GetValidationError(1) answered
//     `Deliberate OnValidate failure for VAL-1 (Select Refresh to discard errors)`.
//
//   * Microsoft's Tests-SINGLESERVER `Codeunit134614.TestRemoveSUPERPermissionsByUserAll`
//     asserts the opposite for its own control, with EXACT equality and no suffix:
//     `Assert.AreEqual('There should be at least one enabled ''SUPER'' user.',
//         PermissionSetByUser.AllUsersHavePermission.GetValidationError(1), ...)`.
//
// Those are not the same shape. `AllUsersHavePermission` on page 9807 binds to a page GLOBAL,
// not to a field of "Aggregate Permission Set" — checked mechanically against the page's own
// control-binding map, not inferred from the name. A page-global control stages no row edit, so
// there is nothing for "Refresh to discard" to discard, which is a plausible reason the suffix
// would be absent.
//
// Plausible is not measured, and that is the whole point of this file. AL Runner currently
// implements the split — suffix on a Rec-bound control, none on a page-global one — on exactly
// this evidence, so if the tier says the suffix is there for both, the runner is wrong and
// Microsoft's own assertion cannot be passing either. Both outcomes are worth knowing; neither
// is knowable by reading `Ncl.dll`, which is how the two claims PR #182 had to correct got
// wrong in the first place.
//
// The expected value below is Microsoft's shape, asserted with exact equality so the answer is
// unambiguous in either direction.
