// What a pageextension's `modify(Control)` validation triggers do when the extended page is
// driven as a TestPage.
//
// The claim under test is an ORDER: OnBeforeValidate, then the base control's own
// OnValidate, then OnAfterValidate. Each trigger appends its own tag to Rec.Trace, so the
// assertion is on one concrete string and cannot be satisfied by a run that fired the right
// triggers in the wrong order, nor by one that fired only some of them.
//
// The suite also pins the FAILED path, as its own set of claims: what an Error() inside
// OnBeforeValidate leaves in the page's buffer. That is a statement about BC's page-write
// buffer rather than about modify() dispatch, so it carries its own arms and its own
// negatives -- see the four arms after the order ones.
//
// One of those four is split in a way worth knowing about before editing it. Closing the page
// after a refused write is NOT the same on every supported version: 28.0-28.4 close cleanly,
// 27.0/27.3/27.5 raise "The record that you tried to open is not available." once a
// SUCCESSFUL write has followed the refused one. Measured, corpus run 34328827788. The trace
// claim is green on all eight and is stated without a Close(); the closability claim is
// stated separately, on the case that is green on all eight. Do not merge them back together.
//
// The OnAssistEdit arms pin the third control-acting modify() trigger, and the base-page form
// of the same trigger. Both were entirely unstated: BC's ITestField.AssistEdit returns void,
// so "the trigger ran" and "nothing happened" are the same observable unless the trigger
// leaves a trace behind, which is why every assist-edit arm asserts on Rec.Trace.
