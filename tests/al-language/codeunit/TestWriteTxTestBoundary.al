// Asks whether a write transaction survives a TEST-METHOD boundary. "Test Codeunit Run
// Write Tx" (60254) pins the write-transaction rule around Codeunit.Run WITHIN one test
// method — the guarded form is refused while the caller holds an uncommitted write, the
// statement form is not. Every one of its tests starts with a Commit-carrying Initialize,
// so none of them says what happens when the uncommitted write was made by the PREVIOUS
// test method in the same codeunit.
//
// "Test Isolation Rollback Scope" (60897) answers the neighbouring question about ROWS —
// under TestIsolation = Codeunit an uncommitted row written by one test is still visible to
// the next — and that is deliberately not the same question. A row surviving says nothing
// about whether the session still holds an open write transaction, and the guard on a
// guarded Codeunit.Run reads the transaction, not the row. Both answers hold at once: the
// row survives AND the transaction is gone, which Test06 asserts together.
//
// The tests below are declaration-ordered and share a codeunit, the same way 60897's are.
// Only Test01 and Test14 clear the fixture, and they do so WITHOUT a Commit: they carry no
// TransactionModel attribute, so the platform commits their work at the boundary. A Commit
// inside any of the AutoRollback tests would be refused outright ("Tests cannot call the
// Commit function if TransactionModel property is set to AutoRollback"), and a Commit
// anywhere after Test01 would close the very transaction the next test is here to ask about.
//
// Test07 onwards ask the same boundary question for TransactionModel::None, which the
// platform handles BEFORE the method body instead of after it: every active transaction is
// ended on the way in, and the body therefore runs with no transaction at all. Three
// consequences, one test each — the body starts with no write transaction and may make a
// guarded Codeunit.Run (Test08), a write from the body itself is refused outright with "A
// transaction must be started before changes can be made to the database." (Test09), and a
// codeunit the test RUNS may write anyway, because Codeunit.Run begins a transaction of its
// own (Test10).
//
// Codeunit.Run is not the only AL construct that begins a transaction, and Test10 on its own
// says nothing about the others. Test11-Test13 ask the same question of a report, an xmlport
// import, and a page field's OnValidate driven through a TestPage — one arm per construct,
// because "it is a construct that begins a transaction" is a claim about each of them
// separately and the answer for one does not carry to the next. Each arm writes its own
// marker number and the page arm seeds its own row (Test13a), so one arm coming back refused
// still leaves the other two measurable.
//
// Test01-Test10 were measured on a real BC 28.4.53241.0 service tier. Test11-Test13 are
// measured by the CI run of the pull request that adds them; whatever the tier reports is
// the answer, including a refusal.
