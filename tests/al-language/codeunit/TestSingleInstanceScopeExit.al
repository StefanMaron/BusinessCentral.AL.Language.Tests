// WHAT THIS TEST DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE — read before trusting it as a regression gate.
// It pins the SingleInstance CONTRACT: one instance per test, state kept across scope
// boundaries. It does NOT reproduce the specific defect that motivated it — that defect
// needs a scope to be genuinely disposed rather than merely detached, and none of the shapes
// reachable from a small AL test (a nested local procedure, event dispatch, Codeunit.Run, or
// a Codeunit.Run that errors) reliably reproduce it. It still pins the contract every runtime
// must satisfy regardless of internal caching mechanism.
//
// ONE TEST PER CODEUNIT: the corpus's default isolation is per-codeunit, and any
// SingleInstance cache must be reset at that boundary — two tests in the same codeunit
// would otherwise share one cached instance.
